<h1> Abstract </h1>

Video games can be used as a tool for more than just being a hobby and a form of entertainment media, they can be used as a tool to help a variety of cognitive abilities. A wide range of people can have issues with certain areas that fall under the umbrella of cognitive ability, whether that would be reading, understanding material, or reflexes (Howard). Video games are a tool that can help improve upon those struggling in a certain area by giving exercises and the best thing with video games is that they are very flexible in what can be created due to the ever-changing growth of that space. Since this is a project about the benefits of video games, I thought the best digital tool to use would be a video game itself which is why I chose to use Twine. Twine lets me create my own narrative in a point and click style adventure, while not being the most active genre to use I think it is still the best choice I have as it does incorporate a lot of reading ability and understanding which are areas that would be affected by the use of video games as tools.  Integration of video games in educational settings has been and still is being tested with varying results but still have the same effect of improving engagement and other areas of educational progress (Aggleton). Video games don’t just affect students, it also affects the educator as it teaches them more ways to effectively use their lesson plans in a more engaging way and develop skills themselves (Liat). The branching out to video games as a tool in different educational environments and studies has shown a lot of benefits, for example, while video games are stereotyped in being an unactive activity there have been ways to get people who live that kind of lifestyle to use video games as a way to get active (Alghadier). Reading disorders are also one of the areas that video games have helped out on as a study has showed that they have improved their ability in reading related activities and compared their improvement to other groups of people (Minissi). Educators and scientist have found this area of study interesting as video games have shown that they bring out various critical principles for learning and enhancing broader cognitive skills when being examined during their activities (Eichenbaum). Short term effects are also being studied, beyond educational settings video games are also being looked at for therapeutical treatments as well and how they improve cognitive motor abilities (Franceschini). Video games are evolving past to what they were made to do, and for the better as they can benefit a lot of people in differing scenarios. The inclusion of video games should be welcomed, or at least given a chance, in curriculum, medicine, and other fields that could come to benefit from cognitive improvements.
