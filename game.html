  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>A research topic that has been interesting to me this semester has been that of writings from the 19th century. So I thought might as well let you guys know about some writings from that time while being in that same time frame! I wanted to have fun with this project so I put some alternate endings and different choices you could make but wanted to keep it educational as well. I hope you guys enjoy my project! </p>
